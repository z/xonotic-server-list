# Ping.js

Ping.js is a small and simple Javascript library to ping response times to servers in pure Javascript! This is useful for when you want to display realtime ping times on a status page which are relative to the user.

JS Fiddle Example: http://jsfiddle.net/alfg/sr0tpn4x/

Example in jQuery: http://jsfiddle.net/alfg/xjqbvt2o/

## Usage

```javascript
var p = new Ping();

p.ping("https://github.com", function(data) {
  document.getElementById("ping-github").innerHTML = data;
});
```

## API

```javascript
var p = new Ping();
```

### p.ping(source, callback, timeout)

Creates a ping request to the `source`.

`source` IP address or website URL, including protocol and port (optional). Example: `https://example.com:8080`

`callback` Callback function which returns the response time in milliseconds.

`timeout` Optional - Set a timeout in milliseconds.

## Development

Install project:
```
git clone https://github.com/alfg/ping.js.git
cd ping.js
npm install
npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Run grunt to build distribution files:
```
grunt
```

Open `demo/index.html` in a browser to test results.

## Notes

Javscript itself doesn't have a native way of sending a "ping", so results may not be completely accurate. Since ajax requests are affected by cross-domain issues (CORS), they are blocked by default. `ping.js` is using a method of faking an image loading from any host and timing the response time. If there's a better way to do this in Javascript, feel free to create an issue, or pull request so I can review.
